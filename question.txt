In the companies route
const router = new express.Router();

In the users route
const router = express.Router();

In the auth route
const router = new express.Router();
 
And in the jobs route
const router = express.Router({ mergeParams: true });


The question is why using new
and also when use the other aproach I used in express-messagely

const Router = require("express").Router;
const router = new Router();
